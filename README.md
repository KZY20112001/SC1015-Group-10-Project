# SC1015-Group-10-Project

## About 

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Intro To Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which uses the datasets from World Bank and Global Health Data Exchange to analyse how Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) and Life Expectancy (LE) can be affected by different predictors and to find a set of predictors that can be used to maximize HALE.

## Problem Definition 
- Can we predict the Life Expectancy (LE) and Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) of a country based on other data such as its population, GDP etc?
- Which set of data are the most useful in predicting the HALE and Life Expectancy? 
- Which model would provide the most accurate results?

## Models Used 
1. Multivariate Linear Regression 
2. Regression Trees
3. Random Forest Regression 

## What we learned from this project
- Handling multiple datasets with different formats and standardizing them 
- Merging multiple dataframes into a single dataframe with a convenient format for analysis
- Linear Regression from sklearn.linear_model 
- Regression Trees from sklearn.tree
- Random Forest Regression from sklearn.ensemble 
- Collaborating using Google Colab notebooks and Github
- Concept about feature importances 

## Conclusion 
The random forest model was the best at predicting life expectancy and HALE out of all the 3 models. It seems that both life expectancy and HALE had slightly nonlinear relationships with the data, but a sufficiently robust model such as random forest is able to capture these relationships. It seems that overall, the metrics chosen were able to btter predict life expectancy than HALE, but they can still predict HALE with high accuracy.

While using a robust model makes explanation of exactly how a metric affects HALE more difficult to explain, we can see that both access to basic sanitation services and GDP per capita are the most important metrics across all the models, as well as having positive correlations with HALE. Thus, governments seeking to increase HALE can prioritise increasing the two metrics. However, we must also keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. For example, population density had a positive correlation with HALE, but logically a high population density would put a strain on current healthcare services. Instead, this could be explained by areas with high population densities also tending to be centres of economic activity, with richer citizens.

It can also be seen that current health expenditure brings significant benefits to HALE, but domestic private health expenditure has negligible impact on HALE, implying that government expenditure in the healthcare sector is what causes HALE to rise. Furthermore, age dependency ratio has more influence than CO2 emissions on life expectancy, but they have equal influence on HALE. Thus a government seeking to improve HALE over life expectancy can know to would not need to prioritise tackling one issue over the other and can choose which issue to focus on based on other development goals.

Given limited resources, our model can inform which areas countries can shift their limited resources in order to increase HALE to ensure everyone lives long, healthy lives.
